*   **Check your browser's pop-up blocker:** The Google login window may open as a pop-up. If you don't see it, check your browser's address bar for a blocked pop-up notification and allow it for this site.

### Item & Data Issues

#### **Why can't I see any of my items?**

Here are few common reasons:

1.  **You are not logged in.** If it shows a "Sign in" button in the middle of the screen, you still need to log in before you can see your inventory.

2.  **You have no items yet.** Your inventory will be empty until you add your first item. Click the "Add Item" button to get started. Here's a link to the relevant quickstart guide section:
    * [Quickstart Guide - Adding Your First Item](./quickstart-guide.md/#3-adding-your-first-item)

3.  **A refresh is needed.** 
    * If you've just added an item and don't see it, try using the dashboard's refresh button. It is located in the top right of the dashboard, underneeath the navigation bar. 

    * If that doesn't work, then try refreshing the website page (`F5` for Windows, `Cmd + R` for Mac, or simply with the refresh button in your browser).

#### **How do I update an item's picture?**

To change an existing item's image:

1.  Click the **"Edit"** icon button for the item you wish to update.

2.  In the edit form, click "Choose File" in the image upload field at the bottom of the form. You can now select a new image file from your computer.

3.  Click **"Save Changes"** to confirm the changes. The old image will be replaced with the new one.

#### **I edited an item, but the changes didn't save.**

After making changes in the edit form, you **must** click the **"Save Changes"** button at the bottom of the form. If you navigate away from the page or close the tab before saving, your changes will be lost.
